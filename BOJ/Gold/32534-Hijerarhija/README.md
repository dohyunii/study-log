## [[BOJ-32534] Hijerarhija](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/32534)

> **Topic:** Tree, Graph Theory, Set/Map, Data Structures\
> **Difficulty:** Gold IV

### Complexity Analysis
* **Time Complexity:** $O(N\log(N)})$
* **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$

### Mistakes & Lessons
**Lesson:** unordered_set is slower because average degree of a node is roughly 2, binary search does it faster rather than computing hash everytime.
