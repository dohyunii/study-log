> **Topic:** Tree, Ad-hoc, Constructive
> **Difficulty:** Gold IV

### Complexity Analysis
* **Time Complexity:** $O(\sqrt{K})$ — The algorithm iterates or recurses relative to the square root of the target value $K$ to construct the required tree structure efficiently.
* **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ — Excluding the space required for the output, only a constant amount of auxiliary memory is used during the construction process.

### Mistakes & Lessons
**Lesson:** I learned how to systematically construct a full binary tree using a loop.
