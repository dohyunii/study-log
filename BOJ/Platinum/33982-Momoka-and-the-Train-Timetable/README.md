## [[BOJ-33982] 모모카와 열차 운행표 (Momoka and the Train Timetable)](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/33982)

> **Topic:** Implementation, Data Structures, Soring, Binary Search, Simulation, Set/Map, Priority Queue
> **Difficulty:** Platinum 3

### Complexity Analysis
* **Time Complexity:** $O(N+M+\sum K)$
* **Space Complexity:** $O((M+\sum K)\log(N)+\sum K \log(\sum K))$

### Mistakes & Lessons
**Mistake:** When a duplicate visit coincides with a missing edge, the output was incorrectly displaying "No: Edge Absence" instead of the required "No: Duplicate Visit/Output "Duplicate Visit" instead of "Edge Absence" if both errors occur simultaneously. If a duplicate visit occurred where no outgoing edge existed, the train was treated as having departed. Now, the station is correctly marked as blocked/stuck in this scenario.
