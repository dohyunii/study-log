- Approach: two-pointers, sorting
- Space Complexity: O(n)
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Learned: using two pointers in sorted array.

- Approach: binary search, sorting
- Space Complexity: O(n)
- Time Complexity: O(n^2*log(n))
- Mistakes: Should have used absolute value in binary search as the found answer can be greater than target
